> Simple, JSON-based web platform to ease translation of software projects

![Screenshot](static/simple-trans-screenshot.png)

## Why?

- While there is a number of localisation platforms available, some companies prefer to not host their project content on third party servers if possible.
- For a development process where quick iteration is important, an online approach as a single and unidirectional "source of truth" is much preferable to a file-based workflow.
- All language translations are visible at a glance, which can be helpful for translators and can facilitate coherence across languages.
- Simplicity.
